Imagine building a dynamic prototype for an app where people can find matching connections. The cool part is, you'll learn not just the technical stuff, but also some really helpful skills. We'll dive into the 'soft' skills, like understanding how to read instructions, working together with others, and being a good team player. On the more technical side, you'll get comfortable using important tools, like the command line and version control. This project isn't just about coding. It's like an adventure that helps you learn how to do cool things on the web. By the end, you'll not only have a cool prototype but also a bunch of skills that will help you keep growing as a web developer.",

In the first week, I learned to set up a basic server and then moved on to setting up basic routing for my application. We continued to enhance our server by ensuring it handled routes and served static files.\n\nThe server was required to accomplish at least three things:\n\nBasic routing: I created different routes (e.g., /about, /login) essential for the matching application.\nError handling: It responded with a 404 Not Found if users visited a route that didn't exist.\nServing static files: It served CSS, as well as media files like images, videos, or audio files.\n\nNext, I focused on building the interface and components for the matching application.

After searching the internet for guides and tutorials, I tested out EJS, and it was going great so far.\n\nFor the template engine, I picked EJS because the installation was a bit easier than the rest like PUG and Handlebars. Another reason I went with EJS was that our teacher knew more about EJS than Handlebars or PUG.\n\nI started by creating views and rendering pages using the templating engine, ensuring each route had its own HTML file.

Login is crucial because each user needs their own page where they can manage personal activities, such as posting their pets, liking, and saving found pets. During login, it's important to create a session so that the user doesn't have to log in again for each route on our website. Additionally, having some security measures in place is essential to prevent hackers from easily accessing an account. I took these aspects into account when building the login function.\n\nI also tried to incorporate my individual part of the Tech project, which was updating profile data so that changes are reflected in the database and can be reused. As a user, you might want to change your name, email, or password, and this can be easily managed within the profile page.\n\nLastly, I implemented a logout function so that when the user is finished and wants to log out, the current session ends, and the user would need to log in again to access their page."

Additionally, the text color changes to red briefly to draw attention to this message.\n\n**HTML, CSS**\n\nIn the absence of JavaScript, the settings still function, but some visual enhancements are lost. Unfortunately, without JavaScript, there's no mechanism to prevent users from selecting more than two options. However, the first two options selected will still be sent to the database, allowing for new matches to be generated.\n\n**HTML**\n\nDespite the absence of styling, users can still discern which form corresponds to which element.\nAdditionally, I added a custom footer to enhance the overall user experience."

Eventually, I discovered the random Useless Facts API, which provides random fun facts. I integrated this API into the user settings feature so that every time a user updates their preferences, they receive a new random fun fact.\n\nThe second API I incorporated was the Vibration API from Mozilla Docs. This API allows web apps to access vibration hardware on compatible devices, providing physical feedback to users. I implemented this API to trigger a short vibration whenever a user likes another gamer. Although I initially intended to use it for new match notifications as well, time constraints limited its implementation.\n\nThe Fetch API, which I used for interacting with the Useless Facts API, is a powerful web API for making network requests in JavaScript. It simplifies fetching resources from servers or API endpoints and handling responses, contributing to the dynamic functionality of my project."

To achieve this, I took the initiative to implement three key optimizations:\n\n1. Implementing Gzip Compression: I recognized the importance of reducing file sizes to improve page loading times. Therefore, I integrated Gzip compression, a widely-used algorithm that compresses web pages and files before transmission. This significantly minimized data transfer and accelerated page loading, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n2. Lazy Loading: Recognizing the impact of media content on page load times, I implemented lazy loading. This technique defers the loading of non-essential resources, such as images and videos, until they are needed. By loading these resources dynamically as users interact with the page, we were able to achieve faster initial page loads and optimize bandwidth usage.\n\n3. Image Optimization with Sharp: Understanding the importance of image optimization for performance, I leveraged Sharp, a powerful node module, to process and optimize images. By utilizing Sharp alongside the Multer module for image uploads, we were able to transform and resize images to meet specific requirements. This included converting images to the Webp format for optimal web delivery and resizing them to a uniform size. These optimizations ensured that images were delivered efficiently, contributing to faster page loading and an enhanced user experience overall.\n\nBy implementing these optimizations, we successfully improved the performance and speed of our application, ultimately providing users with a smoother and more responsive browsing experience."

He provided comprehensive lectures covering everything necessary to establish a strong foundation in data visualization. These sessions included theoretical concepts followed by practical applications in small assignments. Additionally, we participated in workshops where we received extra lessons and hands-on guidance. Each week ended with a slightly larger assignment to reinforce our learning, along with two or three workshops given by us students.

The other assignment was about redesigning a bad example of a data visualization. Then, on Tuesday, we had our first workshop. We revisited attributes and variables before tackling the library task. In groups, we sorted twenty books based on different factors like author name and book thickness. This taught us the importance of paying attention to details when sorting. Sometimes, if one rule doesn't work, we need a backup plan. We discovered this when sorting books of the same height. At the end of the workshop, we got the introduction to the slightly bigger assignment for the end of the week. This assignment was all about visual encoding, where we had to explore the concept of visual encoding through a hands-on exercise involving our fridge items. This assignment involved three main steps: Inventory, Abstraction, and Assigning Multiple Attributes."

For each question, we were required to choose five different types of charts or diagrams from those presented by Andy. This exercise allowed us to become familiar with the various types of graphs introduced by Andy. For the final assignment of the week, we had several tasks to complete. Firstly, we needed to gather data for our project, focusing on different types like time, location, and quantities. Next, we had to list variables that fit into the CHRTS model, which includes categories like time, location, and types of relationships. Then, we were asked to sketch out 25 graphic ideas, with five sketches for each letter in CHRTS. Finally, we had to create five visualizations, each explaining why we chose the design we did. This assignment aimed to help us practice collecting data, designing graphics, and explaining our choices clearly. On Tuesday, we had another workshop session where our task was to find three poorly designed and three well-designed infographics as homework. During the workshop, we displayed these infographics by category. This assignment encouraged us to analyze infographics critically, helping us differentiate between good and bad design choices. This exercise was practical, as it allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world examples."

Menno introduced himself and discussed his work. Following this, we engaged in a workshop where we began with a group task before receiving an explanation of the week's assignment. For this first task, we were provided with a dataset from the CBS regarding crime in the Netherlands. Our task was to analyze this dataset and craft ten newspaper headlines for each of five different newspapers. The aim was to showcase the diverse narratives that can arise from a single dataset, demonstrating how facts can sometimes be misrepresented and underscoring the importance of context. At last, we got the explanation for the week's assignment, which is based on a big survey data. This week, our focus was on exploring the dataset and investigating and utilizing various tools. A starting point for the final assignment. For the final assignment of the week, we had to have at least 3 interesting perspectives/concepts based on the survey dataset, presented with sketches and text. Provide an explanation of the data exploration, including the tools used, findings, images, charts, and tables. Reference the angle, framing, and focus in your rationale. Additionally, consider the message you want to convey. For this assignment, I initially struggled to define a clear angle, frame, and focus. While I developed three concepts, ultimately, I didn't use any of them for my final visualization. Instead, I anchored my final visualization around the students' personality types—introverts, ambiverts, and extraverts—based on a question asked in the initial survey we completed in the first week. From this anchor point, I formulated several questions: Do individuals of different personality types (introvert, extravert, ambivert) tend to complete the survey earlier? Is there a difference between genders in this regard? Do extraverted students often choose expressive colors, and do these colors align with their political preferences? Are individuals of different personality types more likely to spend time outdoors or indoors? Is there a difference in the expression of introverts, extraverts, and ambiverts when communicating with friends? Do they use more words or express themselves differently? These questions formed the basis of my exploration and analysis in the final data visualization. With a renewed focus, I began experimenting. Using raw graphs as my starting point, I explored various approaches and looked for potential patterns. Andy's book provided invaluable support and guidance. Step by step, I began transforming the data, calculating averages, and establishing correlations between different variables. Eventually ended up with something I could work with."

We received a final physical workshop from Andy on this topic, where he explained everything in detail. Now, we were onto this week's final assignment. In the previous chapter, I talked about finding a good angle, frame, and focus, along with some initial graphs to work with. This time, our task was to add design, layout, annotation, and color to enhance our work. We had to create a detailed sketch of our chosen concept, making sure our visualization met specific criteria. It needed to be complex, including multiple variables from different datasets for exploration. Additionally, it should provide meaningful insights and clear annotations, like a title and legend. Lastly, we had to consider design elements like color and layout to make it visually appealing. After gathering some feedback on my new setup, I felt ready to tackle my final assignment. Knowing that my data and graphs were in good shape gave me the confidence to move forward. From that point on, I started working on the text, searching for the right words to convey my ideas. I also dove into the design aspect, exploring different fonts and colors that matched what I wanted to convey. It was quite enjoyable, actually, a bit like solving a puzzle with Lego blocks. Everything started to fall into place. I took the time to try out various layout options, and eventually, my research began to stand out. It felt good to not only have strong content but also to present something visually appealing. After some tinkering and experimenting, my research came to life. It was a truly creative process where I could showcase my passion for the subject. It wasn't just an assignment; it was my way of demonstrating what I had learned and discovered.

It provides comprehensive information on various space missions over the years. As for planets, I discovered another dataset on Kaggle called 'Kepler Labelled Time Series Data.' This dataset contains labeled time series data related to planets. In addition to exploring these datasets, I also analyzed some online and interactive visualizations to gather insights into different visualization techniques that I could potentially apply to my own project.

The pressure was on as I needed to revamp my barChart to meet the requirements for the next few weeks. Initially, I started with a Worldmap version 1 project, but encountered obstacles with data size and mapping coordinates. However, I quickly turned to Worldmap version 2, using geojson data, which turned out to be a game-changer. With perseverance and some helpful resources, I managed to get the map functioning smoothly, complete with toggles for different time periods during the Cold War. As I progressed, I added features like a custom tooltip and an information screen for the United States. Despite time constraints, I managed to implement these features and even dabbled in GSAP animations and scroll snap, which added a polished touch to my project. Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding week, and I'm proud of the progress I made in enhancing my visualization project."

For the Colombia project, he has collected data consisting of various drawings, images, and videos. On Wednesday morning, we had the debrief of the Colombia project. Our client is Jan Rothuizen, and he wants to convey his experience through his drawing style. The goal is to take the user on a digital interactive journey to Colombia. It's a travel story where he guides you through Colombia, highlighting four special places. He has sketched these places and included other media files. From these files, we will create an interactive story for mobile users.Of the four different locations, the love hotel location was selected. This is a place where couples come together to celebrate love. These love hotels are common because in Colombia, children often live with their parents until their 20s. For this location, we received a drawing of the hotel and information about the rooms, with one room detailed. During Jan and Juul's story, Eefje made some notes, including notes about the client's wishes, the technical requirements of the product, and other noteworthy details. After the initial meeting, we decided to briefly come together to discuss our thoughts on the assignment and brainstorm some initial ideas. We had our first coaching session on a Thursday. It was a bit last-minute because we had our initial meeting with the client on Wednesday. Therefore, we arrived with our debrief and the notes from this meeting. The coaching feedback indicated that we should focus more on our location rather than the entire story. Additionally, it was important to determine our target audience and how we could make the story interesting for them. It was then up to us to figure out how to bring the story to life interactively. We shouldn't have been limited by our capabilities and should have come up with the craziest and biggest plans. We agreed to pitch two proposals on Monday and finalize a concept for the vacation week. After the feedback, we decided to think carefully about who our target audience was. Jan's work fell under art and was likely mainly accessible to young adults/adults passionate about art. It also became clear from our conversation with Jan that he enjoyed keeping the project somewhat vague, as art could sometimes be. Additionally, the expectations of this target audience often involved being inspired or entertained by the art. This was also a goal for us to incorporate into our project. With this feedback and the project debrief, we could conclude the first week. Our plan was to come up with a concept over the weekend to present on Monday to Jan and Juul."

We explored options like augmented reality, endless drawing, gamification, and scrollytelling. Concept Presentations We developed two main concepts: one based on scrollytelling and another on endless drawing. We presented our scrollytelling concept to the client. They appreciated our approach but suggested adding more depth and narrative to the story. Client Feedback The client liked our use of animation and paper-like aesthetics but advised us to make the story more non-linear and narrative-driven. They also suggested incorporating torn paper elements and conducting desk research for added depth. Debrief and Concept Refinement After the meeting, we discussed the feedback and decided to focus on telling Jan's story from his perspective. We aimed to emphasize the uniqueness of his drawings by giving the digital story a paper-like look and feel. New concept Our new idea was to tell the story of Jan's visit to Cali and the Kiss Me Motel from his perspective. Users will see the situation through Jan's eyes, experiencing his adventure and understanding his creative process through his unique drawings. We'll create a digital story with a paper-like aesthetic to enhance the experience. Second Coaching Feedback During the coaching session, we received positive feedback on our concept but were advised to add more depth to the narrative. We realized the importance of balancing factual details with Jan's subjective perspective in our storytelling approach. Next Steps We plan to further refine our concept, incorporating the client's feedback and adding depth to the narrative. Our goal is to create a compelling digital experience that takes users on a journey through Jan's perspective while preserving the essence of his unique artistic style."

Client Feedback Users should move freely without buttons. Add smooth transitions. Use Jan's character sparingly. Keep navigation simple. Consider adding sound for ambiance. Avoid gamification. Applying Feedback Based on the feedback, we decided to eliminate buttons from the concept to ensure a seamless storytelling experience. Instead, we aimed to guide user interaction through alternative means. We also focused on creating a single, intuitive navigation method for the entire story. Third Coaching Feedback During the coaching session, we were advised to develop a more cohesive narrative structure and add layers of depth to the story. We brainstormed various ideas, eventually deciding to shift the focus from Jan's perspective to that of a couple experiencing the adventure. This new approach would provide a clearer narrative arc and allow for a deeper exploration of the couple's experiences."

Avoiding waving characters for privacy reasons. Considering color inversion for nighttime scenes. Exploring how to incorporate the car element. Applying Feedback After getting feedback from the client, we immediately went back to school to organize our story properly. Now, we're following a couple in our story as they share their thoughts and feelings. To make the drawings less overwhelming, we decided to let the couple narrate the text within them. This makes the story more engaging. Third Coaching Feedback During our coaching session this week, Maaike joined us again. We updated her on all the changes we've made so far (which was almost everything). Maaike was very excited when she saw our progress. She suggested using sound to enhance the atmosphere of Colombia and the motel even more. We were advised to keep working hard because we still had a lot to accomplish. On the technical side, things became a bit easier for us because we were allowed to embed videos in the code if they didn't require interactions. Next steps After the coaching session, we regrouped on Friday and continued working diligently on our prototype. We decided to refine the Figma prototype as much as possible and focus on developing the tech prototype where interaction is possible. On this Friday, we finalized all the conversations since they play a crucial role in the storyline."

We dedicated the upcoming days to ensuring that the interactive features functioned properly in the code and that the Figma prototype was fully completed. Our main focus was on ticking off all the items on our checklist to be prepared for the delivery scheduled for Thursday. We connected all segments of the story, creating a cohesive narrative. While the entire story was visible in Figma, not all interactions were fully developed. We relied on the code for this aspect, although it wasn't as refined as we had hoped. Nevertheless, we ensured that users could freely navigate within the drawing, considering it a crucial aspect Once completed, we began working on the final presentation for Thursday to share our process with everyone. If we had more time, there were a few points we would have liked to address: Ideally, we would have coded everything. Further development of an ending where the couple walks outside. A bit more consideration regarding the privacy aspect of the couple and the Kiss Me Motel. technical side Because I was the only one in our team with a technical background, they relied on me to focus on the technical aspects. Due to the feedback we received, we had to iterate on our project, which took longer than expected. As a result, I didn't have time to spend on the technical side of the project as much as I would have liked. Here's an overview of what I did accomplish: Firstly, I was advised to use reveal.js to create a slide-like presentation where I could embed videos. For the drawings, I wanted to implement scrolling functionality, allowing users to scroll through the drawing. To achieve this, I installed panzoom.js, which enables scrolling through images. For the part where I wanted to reveal text as the user scrolled over an object or part of the drawing, I used an intersection observer. If the object was in view, the intersection observer added an attribute to it, making the text visible with opacity 1. Next, we wanted to indicate to the user that they could continue without the need for a button or explicit instruction. We aimed to do this intuitively, so when all the text was revealed, the lights of one of the bedrooms would flicker on. Zooming in on this part would signal the user to proceed to the next part of the story. One challenge I encountered was that reveal.js and panzoom.js conflicted with each other. reveal.js required a swipe to navigate to the next slide, while panzoom.js needed a swipe to move the drawing, resulting in functionality issues. I was disappointed that I couldn't resolve this issue given the time constraints we faced. Despite some obstacles, I am still proud of what our interactive web application has become."
